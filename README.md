# Schedge-Backend

## Description
<p>

Introducing our newly developed REST API 🚀  designed for seamless interaction with a time-table scheduling front-end. This API serves a range of essential functions, including <b> user authentication, verification, and the ability to save various pre-processing parameters for the scheduling algorithm </b>.

It enables the creation of optimized schedules based on input data while ensuring clear and easily understandable responses for debugging and input verification purposes. With this API, you can streamline your scheduling processes and enhance overall efficiency. 

<b>The implemented front-end (reactjs) for this particular backend can be found at :- </b><br/> <br/><a class="link" href="https://github.com/nandurijv/t-gen"><i class="fa-light fa-link"></i> T-Gen</a></p> <br/>

## Technologies Used

<b>Flask</b> 🌶️ : A lightweight web framework for building Python applications.

<b>Flask-Bcrypt</b> 🔒: A Flask extension that provides password hashing and verification functionality.

<b>Flask-Cors</b> 🔄 : A Flask extension that adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support to handle cross-domain requests.

<b>Flask-Mail</b> 📧 : A Flask extension for sending email messages.

<b>Flask-RESTful</b> 🌐 : An extension for building RESTful APIs using Flask.

<b>Mongoengine 🍃 :</b> A Python Object-Document Mapper 
(ODM) for MongoDB that provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the database.

<b>PyJWT 🎫 :</b> A library for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Python.

<b>python-dotenv</b> 🌳 : A Python library that allows reading variables from an environment file, typically used for managing environment configurations.

This tech stack utilizes Flask as the main framework, along with various Flask extensions for additional functionality. The project also incorporates MongoDB as the database and includes libraries for password hashing, CORS support, email sending, RESTful API development, JWT handling, and environment configuration management.

## Features

1. Schemas
    
    There are three schemas in this application, namely : 
    
    - **user** ( who creates the schedule )
    - **tags** ( saved by the user )
    - **schedule** ( generated by the algorithm )


2. Middlewares

    The authentication for private routes is provided through the **auth_model** middleware using JWT authentication.

3. Models

    Each route ( public or private ) when reached either through **GET, POST, PUT or DELETE** methods calls different functions that need to be run. These functions (according to the schema on which they are called) are defined in this directory.

5. Environment Variables

    The project makes use of some environment variables which control parameters like ***sender's mail, db host, mail password, port number, production environment, etc.***

6. Genetic Model

    The genetic model processes the input taken from the user such as ***the tag information and the activity list that needs to be scheduled.***

## Getting Started
Welcome to the project! This guide will help you get started with setting up and running the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [MongoDB Database (local or Atlas)](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Python3.9 or Greater](https://www.python.org)

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. Clone the Repository in your local machine
    ``` bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/nandurijv/schedge-backend.git
    $ cd schedge-backend
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment
    ``` bash
    $ python -m venv venv
    ```
    For Mac OS / Linux / Ubuntu:
    ``` bash
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    For Windows:
    ``` bash
    $ venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install the required packages

    ``` bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

This API is a use case of implementing Genetic Algorithm for time table scheduling. The basic application for this api is to enable user authentication, verification and creation of a schedule based on certain info provided by the user. The sample flow of the api calls is as follows:

- User Signs Up
- User logs In
- User Creates Tags of his choice
- User Submits a list of Activities
- User Gets a Schedule Generated from the list of activities using the Genetic Model
- user can view his created Tags
- User can view his saved Schedules
