# We have a set of activities of a schedule.
# Each schedule has a fitness value based on the arrangements of activities.
# Safe to say that the activities of the schedule are its genes.
# Cannot alter the properties of gene for selection.
# can only alter the position of the gene.
# Suppose we initialise a population randomly.
# For a set of n activities, spanned over m intervals, we have n^m ways of allocating an interval.
